Create boilerplate for JUnit tests:
    TestReverser.java
    TestFeeder.java
    TestCLI.java
Write tests for Reverser.reverse() using Random.nextInt as a guide,
terminating early after 30 seconds
    Test 1-4: small integer, modulus not a power of 2
    Test 9-16: large integer, modulus not a power of 2
    Test 11-15: small integer, modulus power of 2
    Test 16-20: large integer, modulus power of 2
    Test 21-24: n+1 testing for each prior case
    Test 25-34: Floating point number tests, bit for bit
    Test 35-???: Any other randomizable data type that has not been tested yet
Write Reverser.reverse() to pass each group of tests at a time
